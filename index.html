    OpenWrap is the premier
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package manager</a> for .NET.</h1>
<p>
    Any .NET project beyond "hello world" is going to require external libraries and
    tools. There's an abundance of free, open source libraries out there, but how do
    you get what you need? Manually searching, downloading (and in some cases building
    from source) is not a productive use of your time. It's even worse when one library
    depends on another and you have to manage dependency chains!
</p>
<p>
    The solution: <strong>OpenWrap</strong></p>
<p> 
    For example, say you want to use OpenRasta in your project. Simply run this at
    the command line:</p>
<code>
    <pre>o add-wrap openrasta-devtools</pre>
</code>
<p>
    OpenWrap will query available repositories for the OpenRasta "wrap" and download
    it along with all the necessary dependencies, such as Castle.</p>
<p>
    Wraps are simple zip files containing the binaries, tools and other useful content.
    They are copied into your project in an xcopy-friendly manner.</p>
